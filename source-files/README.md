SECFC (Survey-Embedded Carbon Footprint Calculator) is a transparent,
open-source R package designed to assist researchers in environmental
psychology with survey-based carbon footprint estimation.

It provides a modular structure that makes it easy to calculate and
analyze emissions from various domains such as consumption, food,
housing, transport, and pets.

SECFC is particularly suitable for academic studies requiring
reproducibility, transparency, and process-level emissions output.

## Key Features

- Twelve core functions to estimate individual-level carbon footprint
  based on survey data.
- Ô∏è Transparent processing: Choose between total emissions or detailed
  calculation steps.
- Designed with survey data structure in mind.
- Ideal for environmental psychology, behavioral science, and carbon
  impact studies.

## Ô∏è Functions Overview

SECFC contains twelve main functions, divided into two groups:

### ‚û§ Simple Output Functions

These functions calculate total emissions by domain and append one new
column to the dataset: - `calc_cons_emissions()` ‚Äì consumption-related
emissions - `calc_food_emissions()` ‚Äì food-related emissions -
`calc_housing_emissions()` ‚Äì housing-related emissions -
`calc_pet_emissions()` ‚Äì pet-related emissions -
`calc_transport_emissions()` ‚Äì transport-related emissions -
`calc_total_emissions()` ‚Äì total emissions across all domains

Each function: - Takes a data frame as input - Appends a new column with
calculated emissions - Returns the updated data frame and prints results

### ‚û§ Process-Level Functions

These functions provide detailed emissions breakdowns, appending
multiple columns with intermediate steps: -
`calc_cons_emissions_process()` - `calc_food_emissions_process()` -
`calc_housing_emissions_process()` - `calc_pet_emissions_process()` -
`calc_transport_emissions_process()` - `calc_total_emissions_process()`

Each function: - Adds multiple columns explaining the step-by-step
calculation - Enhances transparency for research and teaching purposes -
Also returns and prints the final emission result

## Getting Started

Install the package

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jianing-d/SECFC", subdir = "SECFC")
```

## How to Use SECFC

Follow these steps to calculate survey-based carbon footprints using
SECFC.

### Step 1: Load the Package

After installation, load the package with:

``` r
library(SECFC)
```

### Step 2: Import Your Survey Dataset

Make sure your dataset is in a data frame or tibble format. If you‚Äôre
using the Qualtrics template we provided, ensure that variable names
match exactly. Here is an example of the expected data structure:

``` r
library(tibble)

data <- tribble(
  ~StartDate, ~EndDate, ~Status, ~IPAddress, ~Progress, ~`Duration (in seconds)`, ~Finished, ~RecordedDate, ~ResponseId,
  ~RecipientLastName, ~RecipientFirstName, ~RecipientEmail, ~ExternalReference, ~LocationLatitude, ~LocationLongitude,
  ~DistributionChannel, ~UserLanguage, ~Q39, ~CL_01_ClothingPurcha, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_9, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_10, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_11,
  ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_12, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_13, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_14, ~CL_03_MonthlyEx_15, ~F_01_DietaryHabits_5,
  ~F_01_DietaryHabits_6, ~F_01_DietaryHabits_7, ~F_01_DietaryHabits_4, ~T_01_CarUsage, ~T_02_CarType, ~T_03_CarDistance,
  ~T_04_PublicTransport, ~T_05_PublicTransport, ~T_06_AirTravelLong, ~T_07_AirTravelShort, ~T_08_LongDistanceTra,
  ~EH_02_ElectricityBil_1, ~EH_03_ElectricityBil_1, ~EH_05_NaturalGasBill_1, ~EH_06_NaturalGasBill_1, ~PETS_4, ~PETS_5,
  ~SD_06_HouseholdSize_17, ~SD_06_HouseholdSize_18, ~SD_06_HouseholdSize_19, ~SD_07_Country, ~SD_08_ZipCode,
  
  "3/20/25 9:43", "3/20/25 9:47", "IP Address", "111.187.123.25", 100, 240, TRUE, "3/20/25 9:47", "R_3lENNCNKNsOdbgd",
  NA, NA, NA, NA, 31.2222, 121.4581, "anonymous", "EN", "Yes, I accept to proceed to the study",
  "7-12 times (About every 1-2 months)", 30, 250, 50, 0, 50, 100, 200, 7, 3, 4, 6, "5-6 days",
  "Gasoline Vehicle", "11-50 km or 6.2-31 miles", "Weekly", "5-10 km or 3.1-6.2 miles", "1-3 flights",
  "1-3 flights", "Monthly", 120, 1440, 50, 600, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, "United States", 10001
)
```

‚úÖ Note The following columns are automatically generated when you
export responses from Qualtrics: ~StartDate, ~EndDate, ~Status,
~IPAddress, ~Progress, ~`Duration (in seconds)`, ~Finished,
~RecordedDate, ~ResponseId,  
~RecipientLastName, ~RecipientFirstName, ~RecipientEmail,
~ExternalReference, ~LocationLatitude, ~LocationLongitude,  
~DistributionChannel, ~UserLanguage

### Step 3: Run Emission Calculations

Now you‚Äôre ready to calculate emissions. Choose the functions depending
on whether you want only the calculation results or also the process
data.

``` r
# Step 1: Load the package
library(SECFC)

# Step 2: Load your dataset
# Example: use "questionnaire_sample.rds"
df <- readRDS("questionnaire_sample.rds")

# Step 3: Calculate carbon emissions by domain
cons <- calc_cons_emissions(df)       # Adds consumption emissions
